      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Max Emilian Verstappen is a Dutch and Belgian racing driver who competes under the Dutch flag 
        in Formula One for Red Bull Racing. Verstappen has won four Formula One World Drivers' Championship
        titles, which he won consecutively from 2021 to 2024 with Red Bull, and has won 71 Grands Prix across
        11 seasons.<br>
        Born in Hasselt and raised in Maaseik, Verstappen is the son of Dutch former Formula One driver Jos 
        Verstappen and Belgian former kart racer Sophie Kumpen. After a successful karting career—culminating
        in his record-breaking 2013 season—Verstappen graduated to junior formulae. Progressing directly to
        FIA European Formula 3, Verstappen broke several records on his way to third in the championship in
        his rookie season with Van Amersfoort.<br> Aged 17, Verstappen signed for Toro Rosso in 2015 as part
        of the Red Bull Junior Team, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history at the Australian Grand Prix. 
        Following several points finishes in his debut season, Verstappen retained his seat for 2016 before 
        being promoted to parent team Red Bull after four rounds. On debut for Red Bull, aged 18, Verstappen 
        won the Spanish Grand Prix, becoming the youngest-ever driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix. 
        Verstappen achieved multiple race wins in his 2017 and 2018 campaigns, before finishing third in both 
        the 2019 and 2020 World Drivers' Championships under Honda power.<br>
        Verstappen won his maiden title in 2021 after overtaking Lewis Hamilton on the final lap of the last 
        race of the season, becoming the first World Drivers' Champion from the Netherlands. Verstappen won 
        the next two championships in 2022 and 2023, overturning the largest points deficit in Formula One 
        history in the former and breaking numerous records across both seasons. He secured his fourth 
        consecutive title in 2024 after winning nine Grands Prix, including a widely acclaimed wet-weather 
        performance in São Paulo, to become the first driver to win the championship driving for a third-placed
        constructor in 41 years. He finished runner-up by two points in a three-way title battle with Lando 
        Norris and Oscar Piastri in 2025.<br>
        As of the 2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Verstappen has achieved 71 race wins, 48 pole positions, 36 fastest
        laps, and 127 podiums in Formula One. In addition to being the youngest Grand Prix winner, he holds 
        several Formula One records, including the most wins in a season (19), the most podium finishes in a 
        season (21), the most consecutive wins (10), and the most consecutive pole positions (8, shared with 
        Ayrton Senna). Verstappen is contracted to remain at Red Bull until at least the end of the 2028 season.[1] He has also competed professionally in sim racing since 2015, winning several marquee iRacing events. Verstappen was listed in the 2024 issue of Time as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 2022.
