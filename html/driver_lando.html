    <section class="driver-bio">
      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        Lando Norris is a British racing driver who competes in Formula One for McLaren.
        Norris won the Formula One World Drivers' Championship in 2025 with McLaren, 
        and has won 11 Grands Prix across seven seasons.<br>
        Born in Bristol and raised in Glastonbury to an English father and Belgian mother, 
        Norris began competitive kart racing aged eight. After a successful karting career—culminating in his 
        victory at the direct-drive Karting World Championship in 2014.<br>
        Norris graduated to junior formulae. He won his first title at the 2015 MSA Formula Championship with
        Carlin. He then won the Toyota Racing Series, Formula Renault Eurocup, and Formula Renault NEC in 2016, 
        receiving the Autosport BRDC Award that year. Norris won the FIA Formula 3 European Championship in 2017, 
        and finished runner-up to George Russell in the FIA Formula 2 Championship in 2018, both with Carlin.<br>
        A member of the McLaren Young Driver Programme since 2017, Norris joined McLaren in 2019 to partner Carlos Sainz Jr.,
        making his Formula One debut at the Australian Grand Prix. He achieved his maiden podium finish and fastest lap at the 
        season-opening Austrian Grand Prix in 2020, before achieving his maiden pole position at the Russian Grand Prix in 2021,
        amongst several further podiums. Following another podium in 2022, he took seven across his 2023 campaign. In 2024, Norris 
        achieved his maiden win at the Miami Grand Prix, repeating this feat three times as he finished runner-up to Max Verstappen 
        in the World Drivers' Championship. He took seven further victories in 2025, including his home Grand Prix in Britain, as he 
        won his maiden World Drivers' Championship in a title battle with Verstappen and teammate Oscar Piastri.<br>
        As of the 2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, Norris has achieved 11 race wins, 16 pole positions, 18 fastest laps, and 44 podiums in
